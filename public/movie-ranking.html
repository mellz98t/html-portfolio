<h1>Melodye's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Top three movies of all time</h2><hr>
<h3>Rush Hour 1,2, and 3</h3>
<p>These movies are classics and hilarious. When i talk about scenes of these movies with other people they know exactly what im talking about and we have a blast laughing and talking about them</p>
<h3>I Am Legend</h3>
<p>The suspense that this movie had on me was insane. Will Smith really outdid himself with this movie and i cant wait untill the 2nd part comes out!</p>
<h3>Raya And The Last Dragon</h3>
<p>Of course I had to put a disney movie in here. The story behind this movie is incredible and to top it all off this movies is also a comedy and i love me a comedy, but make sure to grab some tissues as well.</p>
